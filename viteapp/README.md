# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# How to use Vite

Vite is essentially the same as Create-React-App, except it's much faster lol.

Run React app in localhost:

```
npm run dev
```

Build Vite App (the files will be stored in ./dist, with static files in ./dist/assets/)

```
npm run build
```

Install all the dependencies in the project (package.json will show what dependencies are included)

```
npm install
```

More about npm:

```
npm help
```
